						<p>
						An experienced Software Developer in an agile environment, completed a Software Design and Development course in 2014-2015, my background is a Honours BSc Degree in IT with business which I followed with 7 years working in Application Support. I feel the support work has given me a better understanding of the User, to allow for better design and development.</p>
						<p>
						The year and 4 months I spent at IBM in Dublin was a great start to my development career. I was on a team that was making strides using new technology and creating a continuous integration platform. I developed key features in JavaScript with Dojo on a webmail application called Verse, where I also coded unit tests with Jasmine and Selenium automation tests in Java.</p>
						<p>
						I like to get involved in various projects, like the Front End Development Hackathon held in IBM. It was a week of learning about responsive and responsible development. Our team of 6 won first place out of 14 teams. We developed in Node.JS and created in just 2 days a web app that used 2 APIs that none of us had ever tried before. We broke new ground and learnt so much. A great experience!</p>
						<p>
						Based in Austin TX, and available at short notice under a valid J1 visa (Nov 16-17 validity). Always looking for new challenges and trying new languages to broaden my spectrum of full stack development. I have been doing online courses recently to up-skill with CodeSchool courses in Python, Ruby and Node.js.</p>

						<h2>Recommendations</h2>
						
						Mark Wallace - Software Architect at IBM in Ireland
						<blockquote>
						I worked with Patricia on Front End Development for IBM Verse. Patricia is highly motivated, very organised and very capable developer. She is great person to work with and would have a positive impact on your team. I'm looking forward to Patricia rejoining our team after her travels.
						<br>

						</blockquote>	
						William Brennan - UI Software Developer at IBM
						<blockquote>
						Patricia is very hard working and reliable. An asset to any team both in terms of her work and social abilities. She is extremely organised and is always hungry to learn new skills and approaches to problems.

						</blockquote>
	
						David Pope - Software Design Engineer
						<blockquote>
						I was in University with Patricia from 2014-15. Trish is a natural born problem solver, making her an excellent programmer. I remember in University she excelled in class and was always finishing in the top 5% (if not the very top!). I worked with Trish on many projects both within and outside University. She has a fantastic ability to remain cool and collective when the pressure is on, a trait that is so vital in the software development industry. Her aptitude for solving complex computing problems and picking up new technologies was great. She has a great ability to share her knowledge, having an open upbeat and personable personality. I would have no hesitation in recommending Trish for any software development role.
