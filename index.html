						<p>
							With over 10 years of experience in software engineering, I have built impactful applications and tools that address both technical challenges and user needs. My journey began with a strong foundation in IT and business, which I complemented with an Honours BSc and a Software Design and Development course. This background, along with 7 years in Application Support, gave me a unique perspective on the user experience, which has been key in my approach to designing and developing software.
						</p>
						<p>
							My career took off at IBM, where I worked on innovative projects using emerging technologies like Dojo and JavaScript, building features for the IBM Verse webmail product and leading automation efforts with Jasmine and Selenium. I was also deeply involved in accessibility, ensuring features met the highest standards.
						</p>
						<p>
							At Bazaarvoice, I transitioned to full-stack development, where I’ve led complex technical projects using modern frameworks like React and Node.js, and built solutions on AWS infrastructure. I've driven initiatives that enhanced privacy and security, improved data authentication processes, and contributed to building a positive, inclusive company culture by mentoring teams and leading onboarding programs.
						</p>
						<p>
							I am passionate about continuous learning, and my journey has always been about embracing new challenges—whether it’s integrating new APIs, adopting new programming languages, or innovating with cloud technologies. My approach to engineering balances technical expertise with a focus on collaboration, mentorship, and improving team performance.

						<h2>Recommendations</h2>
						Brian Josserand - Staff Software Engineer at Bazaarvoice
						<blockquote>
						I worked w/ Trisha, at Bazaarvoice, for about 4 years; on the Content Core team. 
						I found Trisha to be a highly skilled software engineer, particularly on back-end work. 
						Trisha is a great mutli-tasker. She always seemed to be working on 2-4 projects, and handled the work well. 
						Trisha is skilled in Java, Kotlin, Javascript and relational DB (MySQL) technologies.
						Also, Trisha has an earlier background as a dedicated QA engineer, so she writes great tests. 
						I highly recommend Trisha and would work w/ her again if the opportunity arose.
						<br>

						</blockquote>
						
						Nancy Lenz - Lead Engineer/Senior Software Engineer at Bazaarvoice
						<blockquote>
						Trish is a very passionate, motivated, and high-performant engineer. I had the pleasure of working with her on the same team thru many different projects. Boldly embracing new and challenging work, she continuously looks for ways to improve the projects being worked on by the team. She is quick to share ideas with detailed reasoning and has great ability to hold multiple contexts in her head. She is a natural team leader helping to ensure team's work health and organization. Trish would be a phenomenal asset to any development team.

						David Pope - Software Design Engineer
						<blockquote>
						I was in University with Patricia from 2014-15. Trish is a natural born problem solver, making her an excellent programmer. I remember in University she excelled in class and was always finishing in the top 5% (if not the very top!). I worked with Trish on many projects both within and outside University. She has a fantastic ability to remain cool and collective when the pressure is on, a trait that is so vital in the software development industry. Her aptitude for solving complex computing problems and picking up new technologies was great. She has a great ability to share her knowledge, having an open upbeat and personable personality. I would have no hesitation in recommending Trish for any software development role.
